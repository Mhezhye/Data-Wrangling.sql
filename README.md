# Data-Munging-using-SQL
In this project, we transformed and mapped a veterinary clinic raw data using mySQL to make it more useful for further analytics.
The major task was to extract information required for a front end user report from an sql backup file.
We restored a database file (.bak) another sql server. Extracted the information in the template. We also used 3 user defined functions in the sql query
to extract letters only, extract numbers only and to remove rtftags. 
The User defined function script is included in this project.
